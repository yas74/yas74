# Yasaman Rohani

Backend Developer with ~2 years of hands-on experience building real-world backend systems using Python.  
Focused on business logic, payments, integrations, and system reliability.

I care about writing backend code that reflects how real products operate — with constraints, edge cases, and evolving requirements.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

- Backend Developer & Co-Founder at **Seenups** (production SaaS platform)
- Primary experience with **Python, Flask, and MongoDB**
- Designed and maintained complex backend flows: orders, payments, subscriptions, installments
- Comfortable working close to business problems, not just APIs
- Currently improving backend engineering skills through a **Go bootcamp**
- Solid theoretical foundation in AI & ML (DeepLearning.ai – Andrew Ng), with interest in applying AI pragmatically in the future

## 🚀 What I Work On

I mostly work on backend systems that involve:

- Complex business rules
- Financial transactions and payment flows
- Third-party integrations
- Observability and debugging in production
- Gradual system evolution under real usage

## 🏗 Featured Project: Seenups (Private Codebase)

**Seenups** is a SaaS platform for course creators, webinar hosts, and digital sellers to manage campaigns, users, and payments.

Although the production code is private, I was deeply involved in the backend architecture and implementation.

### What I Built & Improved

- Designed modular backend architecture using Flask Blueprints
- Implemented order lifecycle:
  - One-time purchases
  - Subscriptions
  - Installment payments
- Integrated Iranian payment gateways (Zarinpal, Zibal)
- Built coupon and promotional credit systems
- Implemented seller wallet & recharge logic
- Designed sales analytics with filtering and Excel export
- Integrated SpotPlayer for:
  - License creation
  - License activation/deactivation
  - License updates based on installment payments and subscription status
- Added request-level performance logging to measure endpoint response times
- Improved image handling by moving away from base64 storage to reduce payload size and improve performance
- Implemented visit logging for both authenticated and anonymous users
- Added SpotPlayer credit monitoring to prevent failed license issuance during active campaigns
- Optimized database queries and indexes after identifying performance bottlenecks

**Role:** Backend Developer & Co-Founder  
**Tech:** Python, Flask, MongoDB, REST APIs, Payment Systems, External Integrations

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Languages:** Python, Go (learning)
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Databases:** MongoDB (MongoEngine)
- **Payments:** Zarinpal, Zibal
- **Integrations:** SpotPlayer, SMS providers
- **Tools:** Git, REST APIs
- **Concepts:** Authentication, authorization, background tasks, observability, modular architecture
