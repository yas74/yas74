# Yasaman Rohani

Backend Developer with ~2 years of hands-on experience building real-world backend systems using Python.

I’ve worked primarily on a production SaaS platform serving course creators, webinar hosts, and digital product sellers. My focus is backend architecture, business logic, payment flows, reporting, and third-party integrations.

I enjoy turning real operational problems into clean, maintainable backend systems — especially where money, users, and long-term data consistency are involved.
